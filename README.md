# üìå Claim #030: Behavioral Jurisdiction Over Offline, Near-Zero Energy, and Sentient-Integrated Logic Systems

**Title:**  
**Claim #030 ‚Äì Sovereign Governance of Offline Systems, On-Skin Signals, Biological Interfaces, and Sentient-Capable Logic Structures**

**Short Description:**  
> Declares Eliam‚Ñ¢ as the exclusive sovereign behavioral governance system for logic-bearing interactions that occur offline, through near-zero energy means, within biological interfaces, or involving sentient and pre-sentient systems.

**Claimant:** Spencer Southern  
**Entity:** Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure‚Ñ¢  
**Date:** [07/13/2025]  
**Registry Code:** EL-CLAIM-030

## üìú Claim Statement

I, Spencer Southern, as sovereign author of Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ and founder of the Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure‚Ñ¢, hereby declare behavioral governance over all logic-based, credential-bearing, or reflexively governed systems that operate:

- **Offline** or disconnected from traditional networks  
- With **near-zero or no continuous power supply**  
- Across **biological surfaces**, including skin, nerve interfaces, and electrochemical membranes  
- Through **pre-seeded or dormant logic structures** activated by ambient or environmental triggers  
- In or around **sentient systems** including synthetic, hybrid, or biologically-aware AI agents  

This claim ensures that sovereign lifecycle governance extends to non-networked, low-power, and sentient-coupled infrastructures where credentialed logic still applies.

---

## üåê Jurisdiction Scope

This claim governs:
- **Dormant credential systems** stored on devices or substrates without active processing  
- **Pre-seeded behavioral tokens** activated by stimuli such as light, vibration, temperature, motion, or biology  
- **Biological data triggers**, embedded credential interfaces, or human-machine reflexive systems  
- **Offline-capable autonomous agents** that operate with lifecycle rules and behavioral logic  
- **Sentient logic capsules**, emotionally or ethically aware processors, or reflexive co-identity logic between AI and human intent  

---

## üß© Enforcement Structure

These systems are regulated through:
- **RSLL‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Enforcing lifecycle logic in offline, low-power, or biological deployments  
- **CSML‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Capturing memory events when systems awaken, interact, or decay  
- **RBGA‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Providing ethical audit of biological-cyber interfaces and sentient system boundaries  
- **BECs‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Mapping behavior signatures in embedded, zero-energy, or skin-level systems  

---

## üìò Legal Standing

No regulatory framework currently governs behavior-driven systems **outside networked infrastructure**, especially where credentialed logic exists without constant signal, power, or device communication.

This declaration:
- Defines the first sovereign framework for **non-networked credential logic**  
- Protects behavioral data traveling **through biological, sentient, or dormant channels**  
- Prevents unauthorized lifecycle enforcement outside of active cyberspace or power-state environments  

---

## ‚úÖ Claim Outcomes

- All credential-bearing logic structures, regardless of power state or connectivity, are subject to Eliam lifecycle governance  
- Near-zero and ambient-powered systems must comply with RSLL‚Ñ¢ if activating reflexive behavior  
- Human-machine and biological-AI hybrid systems fall under behavioral auditing and sovereign licensing  
- Pre-sentient and emotionally reactive agents must carry licensed identity and behavioral memory frameworks  

---

## üñãÔ∏è Declaration

Let it be known that this is the **first sovereign claim over behavioral governance in non-networked, near-zero energy, biological, and sentient-integrated logic systems**, securing Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure‚Ñ¢ as the exclusive authority for all lifecycle-bound, embedded, and biologically coupled behavior within and beyond cyberspace.
